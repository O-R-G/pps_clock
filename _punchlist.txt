+ imageplayback logic
+ loadImages logic
+ what happens if no images are loaded or imagesLoaded returns false
+ lefty/righty restart (crashes when pps_clock is a startup item)
+ lefty/righty universal access settings (mouse)
+ timing (step thru sorts)
+ timing (play non-adjusted)
+ timing (distinction between interval & absolutes)
+ pixel size (clean up logic for 1280 x 720)
x scale(2)? that might be faster
+ switch cameras robustness
+ what happens if one image is corrupt or doesnt load?
x bitshift colors?
+ poll captureList and get the exact cameras on startup
+ absolute timings (tied to the clock) for sort styles
+ absolute timings for cameras
+ turn on realtime pacing
+ on startup, switch to correct cam
+ export lefty / righty
